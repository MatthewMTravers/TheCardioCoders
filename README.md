## Project Set Up:

1. Install Ollama
2. Make sure Ollama is running before running chatbot
3. Might need to do pip install bs4
4. Install Docker Desktop
5. run the cmd
   curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/milvus-io/milvus/master/scripts/standalone_embed.sh -o standalone_embed.sh
6. start Milvus with cmd (only need to do this once. then you can start milvus in docker desktop. everytime you start it, youll get a bunch of new log files)
   bash standalone_embed.sh start

## Current Project Description:

This application is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that helps users find **relevant exercises** from a dataset and generate responses using an AI model. It combines **vector search (FAISS)** with a **large language model (LLM)** to provide **context-aware answers** to fitness-related questions.

1. Documents are loaded in using JSON responses from various APIs (currently hardcoded, future implementation will query them as needed or create a store for them for persistent use).
2. Using `SentenceTransformer`, these documents are converted into vector embeddings (numerical representations of the text) which are stored in a `FAISS` vector store. This vector store allows you to query the most relevant results based on the embeddings.
3. Based on the "K" best documents selected (smaller values are better for more precise results and faster query times but larger values give more context), the LLM generates a detailed answer and adds it to the  `StateGraph` which manages the flow between steps (retrieving documents â†’ generating an answer), providing a structured and modular way to handle the process.
4. Finally, the response is printed to the user with a relevant answer relating to their initial question.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
